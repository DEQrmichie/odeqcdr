\title{Flag anomalies based on daily summary statistics that deviate from the typical range.}
\usage{
anomaly_check(results, deployment, return_df = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{results}{Data frame of the results data generated using odeqcdr::import_contin().}

\item{deployment}{Data frame of the deployment data generated using odeqcdr::import_contin().}

\item{return_df}{Boolean to indicate if the results data frame should be returned with each of the anomaly stats and final anomaly results. Default is FALSE.}
}
\value{
Vector of the anomaly result as TRUE or FALSE indexed in the same order as the result input. Or if return_df=TRUE a data frame.
}
\description{
A result is flagged as an anomaly (Anomaly = TRUE) when when there is a datetime shift or
the daily summary statistics derived from the results fall outside the monthly 10th or 90th percentile
of the daily mean, 10th percentile of the daily minimum, or the 90 percentile of the
daily maximum for streams of the same strahler stream order; or any stream size
if the strahler stream order is not known. If a result is flagged as an anomaly it
should be closely reviewed.  The 10th and 90th percentiles were calculated from all
available continuous temperature summary statistics in DEQâ€™s AWQMS database collected
between January 1, 1990 and December 31, 2019 with a "Final" or "Accepted" result status.
}
\details{
The typical range for different characteristics are contained in odeqcdr::anomaly_stats
data by month and stream order.
